# MusicPlayerTutorial
A simple music player tutorial from the course 17 Beginner C# Walkthrough Projects.

This is a simple music player, where you can only select one song at a time. There are definitely ways to improve on this simple player, but this is in its simplest form.

When you open the .exe, click "Browse" to find a song you want to hear on your computer. Play, pause, stop, or exit the player.
